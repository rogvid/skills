"""Shared machinery for the demo-video skill's recorders.

`_DemoBase` owns everything that does not care what is being recorded:
the headless-Chromium video capture, the ElevenLabs narration engine, the
caption/interlude overlays, stills, segments, config resolution, and the
ffmpeg conversion. Medium-specific recorders subclass it:

    Recorder          (web.py)      -- drives a web app via Playwright
    TerminalRecorder  (terminal.py) -- runs a CLI/TUI in xterm.js over a PTY

Both record the same Chromium page, so the split is small: a subclass adds
its own context init scripts (`_init_context`), does post-page setup
(`_start`), tears down (`_stop`), and adds its medium's verbs. The frame
source is opaque to `_convert`, which is the seam a future desktop/GUI
backend would reuse.

Configuration: every constructor parameter falls back to a DEMO_VIDEO_*
environment variable so projects can set defaults in .env and keep
storyboards clean. Explicit parameters always win. See the skill's
SKILL.md for the full variable list.

# -- determinism -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Re-recording a storyboard should produce the same video, or "did the UI
# actually change?" is unanswerable and last month's committed still cannot be
# compared with today's. Three things *in the browser* make it not: the wall
# clock, locale/timezone formatting, and animation phase.
#
# They are not equally safe to pin, so they are not pinned together:
#
#   * **Timezone, locale and `prefers-reduced-motion` are always on.** They cost
#     an app nothing — an app that honours reduced motion was built to — and
#     they remove the difference between a recording made on a laptop in
#     Tórshavn and one made on a CI runner.
#
#   * **The frozen clock and the motion rule are opt-in** (`deterministic=True`,
#     `DEMO_VIDEO_DETERMINISTIC=1`). Both change what an app *does*, and mostly
#     they do it silently. Measured on five adversarial pages: a lodash-shaped
#     debounce never fires because `now - last` is always 0, an elapsed-time bar
#     sticks at 0%, a token gate renders "not yet valid", a "last 7 days" chart
#     draws no bars — four of the five produce a plausible wrong screen with no
#     exception, nothing on the console, and nothing in timeline.json. The fifth
#     wedges a `while (Date.now() - t0 < ms)` spin until the navigation times
#     out and no mp4 is written at all. A demo recorder whose default can put a
#     confidently wrong screen in front of a reviewer is worse than one that
#     records a fresh timestamp each take, so the default records the truth and
#     the storyboard asks for reproducibility when it wants it.
#
# What the freeze deliberately leaves alone: `performance.now()`, the document
# animation timeline, and `requestAnimationFrame`. Only the *wall* clock stops.
# Freezing monotonic time as well would stop the compositor, and a page that
# never paints is a page Chromium's screencast never records — it would lose
# wall time (issue #18) in exchange for determinism it does not need. It is also
# why an element that opts out of the motion rule below still animates: nothing
# here touches the clock its animation runs on.
DEFAULT_CLOCK = "2025-01-01T09:00:00Z"
DEFAULT_TIMEZONE = "UTC"
DEFAULT_LOCALE = "en-US"

# Freeze the wall clock at a fixed instant: `Date.now()` and `new Date()` stop
# moving, so a rendered timestamp, a "3 minutes ago", or a date-formatted cell
# reads the same in every take.
#
# Every line below closes a hole that was measured open, so none of it is
# defensive decoration:
#
#   * `Date.now` is *defined on the real constructor*, once, as a named
#     function — not synthesized by a proxy `get` trap. A trap mints a new
#     arrow function per read, so `Date.now !== Date.now`, its `.name` is "",
#     and `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Date, 'now').value` is the real
#     clock the trap never saw.
#   * `Date.prototype.constructor` is repointed at the proxy. Left alone it is
#     the *unproxied* Date, which makes `Date.prototype.constructor === Date`
#     false — a live type-detection idiom in deep-clone and serialization
#     helpers — and hands out an unfrozen clock via `new Date().constructor`.
#   * `Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.format()` with no argument formats "now"
#     from the *internal* clock, which no patch of the `Date` global reaches.
#     It is the highest-impact hole of the set: it is how apps render dates.
#   * `performance.timeOrigin` and `document.lastModified` are wall-clock
#     readings that survive everything above.
#   * A `Worker` gets its own global, so init scripts never run there. The
#     wrapper re-injects the freeze ahead of the real script via a blob
#     shim. Module workers cannot `importScripts` and are passed through
#     unfrozen (issue #29).

# Land every animation and transition on its finished state, so no frame of the
# recording depends on when the take happened to start.
#
# **1 ms, not 0s.** A transition with a combined duration of zero never starts,
# and a transition that never starts fires no `transitionend` — which stalls
# every accordion, modal, carousel and wizard that advances on that event, and
# does it in a way no amount of "move the frozen instant" advice helps with.
# One millisecond is over before the first frame is composited and still fires
# the whole event sequence.
#
# **Authored delays are left alone.** Forcing `animation-delay: 0s` made a
# snackbar declared `dismiss .4s ease 4s forwards` invisible from frame zero:
# the four seconds it is meant to be readable collapsed to nothing. A delay is
# measured from the animation's own start, not from the wall clock, so honouring
# it costs no reproducibility.
#
# **`animation-fill-mode` is left alone too.** Forcing `forwards` looks like it
# guards content that animates in from `opacity: 0`, but such content is always
# authored `forwards` already — and forcing it makes an `alternate` animation
# hold the far keyframe instead of returning, which is not where the browser

#     when the page paints (issue #18), so "no motion at all" is not a free

# -- take issues -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A demo that looks perfect while the app throws on every render passes any
# review that only watches pixels. So the recorders also watch the *app*: the
# browser console, uncaught page exceptions, requests that never completed,
# responses that came back >= 400, and — for TerminalRecorder — the exit status
# of every command `run()` typed. Each becomes an issue on the timeline, and
# each is attributed to the beat that was open when it fired, so a reviewer
# reads "the take broke during `click('#refresh')`" instead of "the take broke".
#
# Issue (part of the envelope's `issues`, same append-only rules as a beat)
#   kind     str   — one of ISSUE_KINDS below
#   t        float — seconds from the start of `media` to *observing* it
#   beat     int?  — index of the beat it is attributed to, or **null** when no
#                    beat can honestly claim it (see below)
#   verb     str?  — that beat's verb, denormalized so the list reads alone
#   caption  str   — the caption on screen at the time, same reason
#   message  str   — one human-readable line
#   plus kind-specific keys: `url`/`line` (console), `url`/`method`
#   (request_failed), `url`/`status` (http_error), `exit_code`/`command`
#   (nonzero_exit)
#
# `t` is when the problem was *observed*, which is not always when it happened:
# Playwright's sync API only delivers page events while it is being called, and
# a command's exit status is only knowable once the prompt comes back. `beat`
# is the attribution to trust; `t` is a hint.
#
# **`beat` is null whenever it cannot be established, and that is a feature.**
# The obvious implementation — blame the most recently started beat — is wrong
# in both directions: it hands an error thrown during a three-second hold to
# whatever beat makes the next Playwright call, quoting a caption that appeared
# after the error did, and it lets a beat that has already closed claim
# something that happened after it. So holds pump events as they wait
# (`_pump_events`), and an event is only attributed to a beat that was open,
# and had been open since events were last known to be flowing
# (`_attributed_beat`). A confidently wrong beat index is worse input for a
# reviewer — or for a conformance gate reading this file — than no answer.

# storyboard never depended on is the recorder's business to report, not to
# veto.
#
# In practice that distinction is narrower than it looks, and deliberately so:
# Chromium writes its own "Failed to load resource: …" line to the console for
# every request that fails or comes back >= 400, and that line is a genuine
# console error. So a strict take *does* fail on a 404 — including a favicon
# — because the browser complained about it out loud. Strict means strict; a
